This is for a Kaggle Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

# Write up No. 1

1. What is the question you hope to answer?
   * Predict if a wikipedia commenent is "toxic" under 6 different cagetories.
1. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
   * https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data
1. What do you know about the data you're using so far?
   * The training data has 159,571 entreies. 
   * The test data has 153,164 entries.
   * The comment tends to ends with some auto-filled text like IP address, use's wikipedia ids, some random strings, or nothing, that probably won't affect the toxic-ness of the comment itself. (But the user-id and IP addresses, if separated into a different, column, might work as a strong signal.)

1. Why did you choose this topic?
   * I don't like those toxic comments and it would make my life better if they can be auto-deleted, although I am also concerned about freedom of expression and removal of my posting by a false identification, which would be very frustrating.
   * I also have some background in NLP and I might be apply some technique for this challenge.
   * There is a chance to win a prize though the change seems less than the chance of winning a lottery.
